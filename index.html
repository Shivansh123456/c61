    <p>
      I am currently 10 years old and after reading a lot of books, which was 3 years ago. Everytime on weekends I wrote a 3-5 page fictional or Non-fictional story or information. A year after that, i started writing bigger stories upto 10-18.5 pages. Once in a project the entire grade was assigned to write at least a fifteen page story
with pictures. We drew the pictures and I managed to write 20 pages. Then i forgot about it all. But 2 years from that time, I started writing more 3-4 page stories. And now i am writing a big story again now. Its title is Sword of Fire. The Epic Proportions. So now i write a page or 2 of my fictional story everyday. This is why I consider writing books as a hobby. But I have many more like reading books, play Among us (A video game), Watch episodes and movies of anime on computer or TV, Coding and playing the Perplexus Epic and a few more I can't think of at the moment. So these are my reasons. Also, I think writing short stories increases a person's imagination. It takes them to the world of fantasy. So writing short stories or long stories are good for your imagination once in a while.

          <h3>1. I chose JK Rowling because she wrote all the Harry Potter books and created a series. All the books are amazing, which shows that JK rowling had an un-imaginable imagination. And I like that.
              2.I also chose Bill Gates because he created microsoft and I am really into computers. Bill gates helped in many things after creating microsoft. New microsoft apps like Microsoft Edge were made. This shows Bill Gates was very smart.</h3>
